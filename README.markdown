# About

Uedit is a simple markdown editor that works as expected in IE6+, Chromium, Firefox, Opera and Safari.

# Features

  * Decoupled interface from the editor for easier modifications
  * Custom state manager for undo/redo operations
  * Automatic insertion of unordered and numbered list items
  * Helper forms for inserting links, images and videos
  * Cross-browser compatible (IE6+ works too, yey)
